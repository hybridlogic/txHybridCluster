A simple Twisted client for interacting with the Hybrid Cluster API as
documented at http://www.hybrid-cluster.com/api

Requirements:

Twisted 11+             http://twistedmatrix.com/
lxml (recommended)      http://lxml.de/

As per the txHybridCluster.Client docstring:

Simple wrapper for the Control Panel XML API, returning responses using the
ElementTree API.

The following examples must be executed within a
defer.inlineCallbacks-decorated function.

Smallest working example:

>>> from txHybridCluster import Client
>>> api = Client("my.cluster.com", "resellername", "somepass")
>>> xml = yield api.testSuccess()
>>> print "Got a successful response from the API", utils.tostring(xml)

Error case:

>>> try:
>>>     yield api.testFail()
>>> except HybridClusterException, e:
>>>     print "Got error:", e

Should print "Got Error: Failed test command."

Something more interesting, creating a website and fetching its website ID:

>>> result = yield api.addExternalDomain(
>>>                    Domain='mydomain.com',
>>>                    Type='wordpress')
>>> stepActionID = int(result.find('StepActionID').text)
>>> yield txHybridCluster.pollStepAction(api, stepActionID)

See the full API documentation at http://www.hybrid-cluster.com/api for
complete details on what you can achieve with the API.

Coming soon, libraries for more languages...
